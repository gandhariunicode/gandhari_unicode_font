# Gandhari Unicode Font

Gandhari Unicode is a font originally developed for Latin transliteration of Gāndhārī language written in the Kharoṣṭhī script, and subsequently extended to support the transliteration of additional scripts and languages.

The Gandhari Unicode font is a modification of the Nimbus Roman No9 font by Andrew Glass, originally for the Early Buddhist Manuscripts Project, between 2000 and 2008. It has since been adopted widely in the fields of Indology and Buddhist Studies.

The Nimbus Roman No9 L font was created by (URW)++ Design & Development and distributed under the Aladdin Free Public License (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/cvs/Public.htm) 1994.

The glyphs in the Greek range were incorporated from the Omega Serif Greek font (omsegr.pfb), which has been developed by the Omega Project 1997. This Omega font is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

All other glyphs were created by Andrew Glass between 2000 and 2008.
