# ttf
TTF font originally developed for Gandhari transliteration, but extended to support additional transliteration schemes.

The Gandhari Unicode font is a modification of the Nimbus Roman No9 font.
It has been modified by Andrew Glass (asg@alumni.washington.edu) for
 the Early Buddhist Manuscripts Project between 2000 and 2008.

The Nimbus Roman No9 L font was created by (URW)++ Design &
Development and distributed under the Aladdin Free Public License
(http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/cvs/Public.htm) 1994.

The glyphs in the Greek range have been incorporated from the
Omega Serif Greek font (omsegr.pfb), which has been developed by
the Omega Project 1997.  This Omega font is distributed under the
terms of the General Public License.

All other glyphs have been created by Andrew Glass between 2000 and 2008.
